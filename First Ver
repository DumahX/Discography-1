    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>Based in Minneapolis, MN and formed in 1997. The band started out with Pierre and Cain after they both left their previous projects and it took them several years to come up with a stable line up. They started releasing music at a fast rate and touring to promote themselves. In 2001 they recorded their debut album, I Am The Movie, that would later be re-released by their first label Epitaph. After 20 years, 6 albums, multiple guest appearances and side projects the group decided to disband. They played their last show in Chicago, IL on September 20th of 2016.</p>
